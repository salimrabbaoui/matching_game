Sock Images Guide

To use the matching game with sock images, you need to add the following image files to this directory:

1. red_sock.png - A red sock image
2. blue_sock.png - A blue sock image
3. striped_sock.png - A striped sock image
4. polka_dot_sock.png - A sock with polka dots
5. rainbow_sock.png - A rainbow-colored sock
6. black_sock.png - A black sock image
7. pink_sock.png - A pink sock image
8. checkered_sock.png - A sock with checkered pattern

You can find free sock images on sites like:
- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/)
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/)
- Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/)

Or you can search for "sock clip art" or "sock png" in any search engine.

Make sure the images are in PNG format with transparent backgrounds for best results.

If you don't add these images, the game will fall back to using sock emojis.
