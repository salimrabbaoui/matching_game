#### A. Create In-App Products:
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your app
3. Navigate to **Monetization > Products > In-app products**
4. Create two products:

```
Product ID: monthly_subscription
Title: Monthly Premium Subscription
Description: Unlimited hearts, no ads, exclusive designs
Price: $2.99
Type: Subscription

Product ID: yearly_subscription  
Title: Yearly Premium Subscription
Description: Unlimited hearts, no ads, exclusive designs (45% savings)
Price: $19.99
Type: Subscription
```

#### B. Configure Subscription Base Plans:
1. Click on each product
2. Set up **base plans** with proper billing periods
3. Enable **grace periods** and **account hold**

### 2. **Apple App Store Setup** (iOS)

#### A. Create In-App Purchases:
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Select your app
3. Navigate to **Features > In-App Purchases**
4. Create two **Auto-Renewable Subscriptions**:

```
Product ID: monthly_subscription
Reference Name: Monthly Premium
Duration: 1 Month
Price: $2.99

Product ID: yearly_subscription
Reference Name: Yearly Premium  
Duration: 1 Year
Price: $19.99
```

#### B. Create Subscription Groups:

2. Add both subscriptions to this group
3. Configure subscription levels (yearly as higher value)

### 3. **Testing Setup**

#### Android Testing:
```bash
# Create test accounts in Google Play Console
# Use license testing or internal testing track
flutter build appbundle --release
```

#### iOS Testing:
```bash
# Use Sandbox environment
# Add test users in App Store Connect
flutter build ios --release
```

### 4. **Code Configuration**

Your code is already properly set up! The product IDs in your code match what you need to create:

```dart
// These are already configured in your SubscriptionService
final Set<String> _productIds = {
  'monthly_subscription',   // ‚Üê Create this in store
  'yearly_subscription'     // ‚Üê Create this in store
};
```

### 5. **Revenue Optimization Tips**

#### A. Pricing Strategy:
- ‚úÖ Your current pricing is good ($2.99/$19.99)
- Consider **free trial periods** (3-7 days)
- Add **intro pricing** (first month 50% off)

#### B. Conversion Optimization:
```dart
// Add to your SubscriptionDialog
final defaultFeatures = [
  {'icon': Icons.favorite, 'text': 'Unlimited Hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è'},
  {'icon': Icons.block, 'text': 'No Ads üö´'},
  {'icon': Icons.auto_awesome, 'text': 'Exclusive Designs ‚ú®'},
  {'icon': Icons.bolt, 'text': 'Daily Bonuses ‚ö°'},
  {'icon': Icons.support, 'text': 'Priority Support üí¨'}, // Add this
];
```

### 6. **Store Requirements Checklist**

#### Before Publishing:
- [ ] Test purchases in sandbox/testing environment
- [ ] Verify subscription cancellation works

### 7. **Advanced Features to Consider**

# Add to pubspec.yaml
firebase_analytics: ^10.7.4
```

```dart
// Test different pricing or feature presentations
final isVariantA = Random().nextBool();
```

#### C. Promo Codes:

### 8. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### "Products not found":
- Products not approved in store
